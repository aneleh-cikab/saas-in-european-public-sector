# About

Repository for the thesis "Software as a Service adoption in the European public sector: Trends and drivers". Thesis was writen as a part of the  Master of Data Science for Public Policy programme at the Hertie School Berlin, under the supervision of prof. dr. Simon Munzert and with a practice partner (Polyteia).

# Overview

Software as a Service (SaaS) is a cloud service delivery model that enables users to access software via the Internet without managing the underlying infrastructure. SaaS offers numerous benefits to the public sector, such as cost reduction, flexibility, and faster deployment. This thesis explores SaaS adoption in the European public sector by analyzing 295,019 software tenders from 28 European countries. SaaS adoption was more likely with higher ICT GDP contribution, tender value, and government R&D investment, and in countries with better innovation procurement regulation. Adoption was less likely where ICT employment and R&D personnel were higher. Public law-governed bodies and regional or local agencies were more likely to adopt SaaS compared to ministries or national authorities, particularly in the electricity and education sectors. The results emphasize the importance of technological, organizational, and environmental factors in SaaS adoption.
